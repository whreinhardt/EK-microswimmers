# EK-microswimmers

## Description
Code used to solve for the pressure, integrate ODE, and fit data in the paper "Electrokinetic Propulsion for Electronically Integrated Microscopic Robots".

## How to use
Download and run the LubricationCodeNat.py file. Using hardcoded data from the paper, the code calculates the pressure and body variables of the robot as outlined in the "Modeling Microrobot Propulsion" section of the Methods.
